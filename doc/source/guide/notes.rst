Notes on implementation
=======================

This section contains some explanations on the code which don't fit in 
the docstrings or the background section.

.. _eval_G_DG:

Evaluation of the equation system and its jacobian
**************************************************

Both the equation system and its jacobian consist of linear and 
nonlinear parts. Therefor their evaluation is divided into these two 
steps.

In the following we denote by :math:`x_i,\  u_i` the spline object we 
created for the :math:`i`-th system or input variable and the first 
derivatives of the system variables by :math:`d x_i`.
