About PyTrajectory
==================

PyTrajectory is a Python library for trajectory generation for nonlinear control systems.
It relies on solving a boundary value problem (bvp) via a collocation method. It is based
on the scientific work of :ref:`Graichen et al. <Graichen05>`, but does not depend on proprietary
code like Matlabs *bvp4c*.

PyTrajectory is developed at Dresden University of Technology at the 
`Institute for Control Theory <http://www.et.tu-dresden.de/rst/>`_, see also
`other control related software <http://www.tu-dresden.de/rst/software>`_.

Based on the project thesis of Oliver Schnabel under the supervision of Carsten Knoll in February 2013
it has been further developed by Andreas Kunze to increase its numeric performance.
