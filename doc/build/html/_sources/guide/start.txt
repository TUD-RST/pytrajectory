This section provides an overview on what PyTrajectory is and how to use it.
For a mor detailed view please have a look at the :ref:`pytrajectory`.


What is PyTrajectory?
=====================

PyTrajectory is a Python library for the determination of the feed forward control 
to achieve a transition between desired states of a nonlinear control system.

Planning and designing of trajectories represents an important task in 
the control of technological processes. Here the problem is attributed 
on a multi-dimensional boundary value problem with free parameters.
In general this problem can not be solved analytically. It is therefore 
resorted to the method of collocation in order to obtain a numerical 
approximation.

PyTrajectory allows a flexible implementation of various tasks.
