Collocation method
------------------

Given a system of autonomous differential equations

.. math::

   \dot{x}_1(t) = f_1(x_1(t),...,x_n(t))
   
   \vdots \qquad \vdots
   
   \dot{x}_n(t) = f_n(x_1(t),...,x_n(t))

with :math:`t \in [a, b]` and *Dirichlet* boundary conditions

.. math::
   x_i(a) = \alpha_i,\quad x_i(b) = \beta_i \qquad i = 1,...,n

the collocation method to solve the problem basically works as follows.

We choose :math:`N+1` collocation points :math:`t_j,\ j = 0,...,N` from the interval 
:math:`[a, b]` where :math:`t_0 = a,\ t_{N} = b` and search for functions 
:math:`P_i:[a,b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}` which for all :math:`j = 0,..,N` satisfy the 
following conditions:

.. math::
   :nowrap:

   \begin{equation}
      P_i(t_0) = \alpha_i, \qquad P_i(t_N) = \beta_i
   \end{equation}
   
   \begin{equation}
      \frac{d}{d t} P_i(t_j) = f_i(P_1(t_j),...,P_n(t_j)) \quad i = 1,...,n
   \end{equation}

Through these demands the exact solution of the ode system will be approximated.
The demands on the boundary values :math:`(1)` ​​can be sure already by suitable 
construction of the shape functions. This results in the following system of equations.

.. math::

   \frac{d}{d t}P_1(t_0) - f(P_1(t_0)) := G_1^0(c) = 0

   \qquad \vdots

   \frac{d}{d t}P_n(t_0) - f(P_n(t_0)) := G_n^0(c) = 0

   \qquad \vdots

   \frac{d}{d t}P_1(t_1) - f(P_1(t_1)) := G_1^1(c) = 0

   \qquad \vdots

   \frac{d}{d t}P_n(t_N) - f(P_n(t_N)) := G_n^N(c) = 0

Solving the boundary value problem is thus reduced to the finding of a zero point 
of :math:`G = (G_1^0 ,..., G_n^N)^T`, where :math:`c` is the vector of all independent
parameters that result from the :ref:`candidate_functions`.
